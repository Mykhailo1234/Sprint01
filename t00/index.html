<p><b><i>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
  couldn’t.</i></b>
  So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could
  possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
  Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p>
<p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest
  story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
  If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he
  becomes a superhero.</p>

  <p>Iron Man</p>
  <p>The son of the wealthy industrialist Howard Stark, Tony was a brilliant inventor and mechanic. He inherited his
    father's business at the age of 21, turning the company into one of the leading arms manufacturers. Tony was wounded
    by a shrapnel wound in the chest during a field test for the suitability of combat armor, which was to endow
    soldiers with combat capabilities. Stark was captured by gunman Baron Wong Chu, forcing him to create a weapon of
    mass destruction - only then would Tony receive the operation needed to save his life.</p>
