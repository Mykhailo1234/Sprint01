  <h1>Franklin Richards</h1>
  <img src="assets/images/images.jpeg">
  <p>Franklin Benjamin Richards is a fictional character appearing in American comic
    books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as a
    supporting character in Fantastic Four. He's generally portrayed as a
    child and as a budding super-hero, albeit inexperienced.Franklin is a mutant,
    beyond Omega level,[1][2] with vast reality-manipulating and psionic powers.
    He is the young son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic
    Four, the older brother of Valeria Richards, and the nephew of Invisible Woman's
    younger brother, the Human Torch. His parents named him Franklin Benjamin Richards;
    his middle name is taken from his godfather Ben Grimm, the Thing. Franklin's first name
    comes from Franklin Storm, his maternal grandfather. He has started using the code name Powerhouse.

  <p>Appearing sporadically in the pages of Fantastic Four over the following fifteen years, Franklin became 
    a member of the pre-teen superhero team Power Pack as of issue #17 (December 1985) of that title until its 
    cancellation with issue #62 (February 1991). From November 1994 an older version of the same character (aged 
    for the purposes of a story) appeared in the pages of Marvel's Fantastic Force until publication ceased as of 
    April 1996. Between appearances in these other titles, Franklin has remained a recurring cast member of the Fantastic 
    Four comic book. From July 2007 until the series' cancellation in February 2009, an alternate version of Franklin appeared 
    as a cast member in the Marvel Adventures all-ages Power Pack series of titles.

  <p>Franklin Benjamin Richards was born in New York City to Reed and Susan Richards.[8] Unlike most mutants (whose abilities 
    are initially activated at the onset of puberty), Franklin began manifesting his powers while still a toddler due to his 
    parents' radiation-altered genes.[volume & issue needed] This drew the attention of Annihilus, who sought to use Franklin 
    as a source for his own resurgence, transferring some measure of the child's latent power to himself with a gene-based machine, 
    and releasing Franklin's full potential in the process. Fearing the immediate threat of his son's powers to the entire populace 
    of Earth and unable to find another solution in time, Reed Richards shut down Franklin's mind.[9]
  </p>
  <p>During a battle between Ultron-7 and the Fantastic Four, Ultron's energy output awoke Franklin and again released his powers, resulting 
    in the sentient robot's defeat. Free of the energies expended in the confrontation with Ultron, Franklin was seemingly returned to his normal power level.[10]
      Needing someone to watch over Franklin in their absence, Reed and Susan Richards came to rely on the services of an elderly woman known as Agatha Harkness,
      [volume & issue needed] who is also a benevolent witch. Franklin and Agatha soon developed a familial-like bond, even residing together for a time at Whisper 
      Hill (Agatha's old residence, which was regularly destroyed and rebuilt). Eventually, Agatha returned to live in the secret witch community of New Salem, 
      Colorado, and Franklin moved back in permanently with his parents and the rest of the Fantastic Four.[volume & issue needed] His powers, no longer dormant, 
      continued to manifest themselves.[11]

    <p>Under the care of yet another guardian, a robot nicknamed H.E.R.B.I.E., Franklin unintentionally used his reality warping abilities to age 
      himself into adulthood.[12] In this form, Franklin was an adept at molecular manipulation and psionics. Upon realizing his mistake, he soon 
      restored himself to childhood.[13]Despite his youth and inexperience, Franklin, a victim of many threats and abductions, has exhibited great 
      courage in the face of overwhelming peril. Time and again, he has unknowingly saved innocent lives, including that of his famous family, from 
      the likes of villainous perpetrators, such as Blastaar,[14] Norman Osborn,[15] Onslaught,[16] Nicholas Scratch,[17] and even the all-powerful 
      Mephisto, whom he temporarily destroyed and later defeated on two separate occasions.[18][19]
